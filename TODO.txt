=== Mighty Maniac Mansion ===

Purple Tentacle should go first to the basement to check the reactor then to the pool then to the valve and close it.
In case too much time will pass make an explosion (for example purple will catch two players)

We need a way to walk on ladders. Probably from the back. Do we need a new anim?

Add a lab secret entrance in the home. But use the same system
