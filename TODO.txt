Mighty Maniac Mansion

Add "Pick by ID" in SList, adding a "comparer" for the ID as delegate function


* TODO ************************************************************************************************************

Create assets for the outside part of the home
Create some assets for the rooms
Have inventory that can be open/closed by clicking on it. (Grapich icons + text for the items)
Add options: music volume, text speed, text size, highlight objects (never, on over, when entering)
Complete intro, adding variations for each character. -> May need extension to the Actions
Implement Conditions on actions (JSON serialization, class storage and actual checking of conditions)
Get music cover from BGO
Add some sounds: door open/close, footsteps
Add start game selection, with selection of kidnapped character and 3 players

Associate Actions to Items

FrontDoor:
-> Doorbell (starts sequence where Ed checks for package and then screams to you to go away)
-> House Spare Key (visible under the doormat when the doormat is open)
-> Bush on the very left to stop walking
-> Graves on the right after the mailbox
-> Backyard entrance on the left
-> Grate covered in grass close to the door on the left
-> Working door


Replace the grate with one without bush, just open/closed
Add a bush as normal pickable object

Interactable -> add "container" as type, with a list of Items (with the placement relative coordinates)
Add Editor for Interactable, like GameAction, to make it easier to handle


* BUGS ************************************************************************************************************

If we walk to an item and the item is on stairs, we cannot use the normal walkto. We should do "paths" (navmesh?)

* ACTIONS ************************************************************************************************************

Usinga object may run an action.
The action may have conditions (variables, timing, performing actor, status of other actions) that may disable or fail the action (not visible or not possible to complete)
The result is something going on (move, change status, set flags, etc) and maybe running other actions

>> Need a way to see actions in Items (not loaded from json)

How to define an action that will change one item with another? Like putting or picking the envelope from the mailbox?
