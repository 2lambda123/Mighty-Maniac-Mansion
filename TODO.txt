Mighty Maniac Mansion



Fix the problem of the paths not being good when the root is moved

Change y speed and x speed. x >>> y to simulate depth


* TODO ************************************************************************************************************

Change walk anims. Do not start with idle pose.

Create assets for the outside part of the home
Create some assets for the rooms
Have inventory that can be open/closed by clicking on it. (Grapich icons + text for the items)
Add options: music volume, text speed, text size, highlight objects (never, on over, when entering)
Complete intro, adding variations for each character. -> May need extension to the Actions
Implement Conditions on actions (JSON serialization, class storage and actual checking of conditions)
Get music cover from BGO
Add some sounds: door open/close, footsteps
Add start game selection, with selection of kidnapped character and 3 players



FrontDoor:
-> Doorbell (starts sequence where Ed checks for package and then screams to you to go away)
-> Make usable the House Main Key
-> Backyard entrance on the left
-> Working door


* BUGS ************************************************************************************************************

If we walk to an item and the item is on stairs, we cannot use the normal walkto. We should do "paths" (navmesh?)
