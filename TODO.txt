=== Mighty Maniac Mansion ===


We miss the sentences to say when an action is not valid or when an action is valid
Some of the actions should be limited to particular actions (Use, Pick, Give, etc.)
Edna behavior looks not working

2) implement all new conditions and logic to check if they are valid [in progress]
3) Have a way to reload a json using a button, and debug Edna scene

When going in the kitched with Edna, we should move the camera to show the fridge. Then do the behavior.

Draw Edna and do the "Check fridge" at start

Do arms forward in all characters

Have a way for actor to "complete a cutscene" as particular status, that can be used to go in rooms and have the actors to be not here (use behaviors?)

Icrease resolution of turkey and roast
Add recycle stuff to the service room
Split again background sounds and normal sounds

* TODO ************************************************************************************************************

Oven with hamster <- path to Ed room <- overn as container <- action with filter to who will do it
Piggy bank with coins
Draw maps

Enable the "prolonged usage" to simulate the push of the gargoyle head and the loose brick. It should go away when the actor moves.
Complete intro Cutscene, adding variations for each character.
Define skills and actions that will allow
FrontDoor -> Backyard entrance on the left
Complete Sandy and Ollie descriptions

* BUGS ************************************************************************************************************

Serious problem when going down from suitescorridor, the destination clicks look completely off
