Mighty Maniac Mansion


Anim for hamster, cursor for hamster, icon for hamster
Position better the balloon. If it goes offscreen, move it in a different place (upside-down?)
Enable the "prolonged usage" to simulate the push of the gargoyle head. It should go away when the actor moves.
Change y speed and x speed. x >>> y to simulate depth
Make again working the scaling of actors while changing y coordinate

Rename Sequence to CutScene

* TODO ************************************************************************************************************


Complete intro, adding variations for each character. -> May need extension to the Actions
Implement Conditions on actions (JSON serialization, class storage and actual checking of conditions)
Get music cover from BGO
Add some sounds: door open/close, footsteps
Add start game selection, with selection of kidnapped character and 3 players



FrontDoor:
-> Doorbell (starts sequence where Ed checks for package and then screams to you to go away)
-> Make usable the House Main Key
-> Backyard entrance on the left
-> Working door


* BUGS ************************************************************************************************************

The z-order of actors is not good. They go behind objects, so they cannot be selected (may be fixed when altering the Y position of the actors while walking)
